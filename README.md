# Portfolio

<img src= "Portfolio-pic">

At the top of the Portfolio, one is introduced with my name followed by a structure of the portfolio

* The nav bar contains an About me section, a work section, and a contact me section reference where all link to their corresponding section.

* When clicking on the work section it takes you to my work, where the main project is my biggest picture. Below are my other projects.

* When clicking on the picture of the first project it takes you to it, however with my other projects since they are still a work in progress it takes you to a link that does not work.

* At the end one is introduced with a contact me footer section with my number, email, and GitHub page. 

* More stuff will be fixed and switched to my portfolio as I progress with future work.
